# AI-Powered Face Recognition Application

## Description

This application is designed to continuously capture and detect human faces through a camera, perform face embeddings using the DeepFace library, and train the model in real-time to recognize faces. The face detection is done using MTCNN, and the embeddings are stored locally to build a personalized face recognition model.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Uses MTCNN for detecting faces in the camera feed.
- **Face Embedding Generation**: DeepFace is used to generate embeddings of detected faces.
- **Continuous Training**: The model continuously updates its knowledge base by training on new images.
- **Face Recognition**: Once trained, the model recognizes faces based on the previous training data.
- **Local Model Storage**: All the training data and model updates are stored locally on your machine for later use.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- MTCNN (Face Detection)
- DeepFace (Face Recognition)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for any further training needs)
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your machine. You will also need to install the necessary dependencies listed below.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-app.git
cd face-recognition-app
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

To start the application, simply run the following Python script:

```bash
python face_recognition.py
```

This will start the camera feed and begin detecting faces in real-time. Once a face is detected, it will generate embeddings and store them for future recognition.

### Step 4: Training Model (Optional)

The application is designed to continuously train the model with new data, but if you wish to train the model manually, you can run the following script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will train the model based on the images already stored in the dataset.

## File Structure

- `face_recognition.py`: Main script to run the application and perform real-time face detection and embedding.
- `train_model.py`: Script to manually train the face recognition model with stored embeddings.
- `dataset/`: Directory where detected face images and embeddings are stored.
- `model/`: Directory for storing the trained face recognition model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the application.

## How to Use

1. When you run `face_recognition.py`, the camera will start capturing frames.
2. It will detect faces using MTCNN and generate embeddings using DeepFace.
3. The embeddings will be stored locally and used for future recognition.
4. As more faces are detected and recognized, the model will improve, and it will be able to recognize previously encountered faces.
5. You can always retrain the model using the `train_model.py` script, which will refresh the training set with newly detected faces.
